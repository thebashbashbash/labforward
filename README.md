# Defenition of done

1. The end user (scientist) is able to detect peaks by glancing a graph of their data.
2. The MVP should be written in React with React Context instead of Redux because I believe
   the new React Context API and React Hooks are the future.
3. The end user should be able to switch between
   their data sets.
4. All components should be tested for successfully using Jest/Enzyme.
5. A very simple test that tests that it is possible to test a shallow state change using Jest/Enzyme (test should be improved by doing a deeper test of state change and by using jest-axios-mock when adding real endpoints).

# Project details

Time: 2.5 hours (1 hours for creating state management, 1 hour for researching with graph library
0.5 hours for writing a simple text that checks state and for some CSS styling)
